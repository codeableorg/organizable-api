### API Authentication

This API uses HTTP Authentication Token. Make a POST request to `/login` with the `username` and
`password` of the test user created through the seed file:

```json
{
  "username": "codeable",
  "password": "123456"
}
```

Since the username and password are valid, the server will return the user information with the authorization token:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "username": "codeable",
  "email": "codeable@mail.com",
  "firstName": "User",
  "lastName": "Test",
  "token": "BNZ6hTF2xDya9AqUuvnu9x7i"
}
```

This token should be included on the `headers` for almost all the other endpoints, otherwise you will get an `access denied` error.

To include the token on your headers, add a `key`-`value` pair in this way:

- `key`: Authorization
- `value`: Token token="`BNZ6hTF2xDya9AqUuvnu9x7i`"
